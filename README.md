# PiPodVolumio
## Description
iPod inspired MP3 software that runs on top of Volumio OS software for Raspberry Pi. Designed and tested on Raspberry Pi Zero 2w and uses PiTFT 2.2 by Adafruit as a display. Based on the original PiPod project.
## Background
This code operates on top of the Volumio Operating System as installed from the Raspberry Pi Imager.

[//]: # (In the future, when this project is closer to completion, I plan to include my own full explanation of and install tutorial for the Volumio platform. Online tutorials I have found at this time do not adequately explain the install process I used and thus I cannot guarantee compatibility)

## Attribution
This project utilizes Code from the Adafruit Project. [adafruit-pitft.py](https://github.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Script) contains substantial original code by Melissa LeBlanc-Williams for Adafruit Industries. 

## Notice project intent change
As of now, I no longer intend to run this project on VolumioOS as it has caused many compatability issues with a number of RasPi tools. I will leave this script up for posterity as it does successfully configure an Adafruit PiTFT screen to operate within the Volumio operating system.
