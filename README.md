# PiPodVolumio
## Description
iPod inspired MP3 software that runs on top of Volumio OS software for Raspberry Pi. Designed and tested on Raspberry Pi Zero 2w and uses PiTFT 2.2 by Adafruit as a display. Based on the original PiPod project.
## Background
This code operates on top of the Volumio Operating System as installed from the Raspberry Pi Imager.

[//]: # (In the future, when this project is closer to completion, I plan to include my own full explanation of and install tutorial for the Volumio platform. Online tutorials I have found at this time do not adequately explain the install process I used and thus I cannot guarantee compatibility)
